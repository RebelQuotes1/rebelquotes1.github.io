<h1>My First Winter Off-Grid</h1>
<p>I thought I was tough. The cold had other plans.</p>
<p>Water froze in my thermos. My boots froze to the floor. I cursed everything. And then I figured it out.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way: prep smarter, not just harder. Cold doesn’t negotiate. It erodes you slowly.</p>
<p>I made it out. Barely. And now, I overprepare for every winter. Because cold is cruel, but predictable.</p>
