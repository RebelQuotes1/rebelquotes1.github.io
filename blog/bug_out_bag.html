  <h1>Top 10 Bug-Out Bag Essentials</h1>
  <p>Your bug-out bag isn’t just a backpack — it’s your last lifeline when the world burns down. Pack it smart, pack it tight, and for the love of grit, don’t forget the stuff that actually matters.</p>

  <h2>1. Water Filter</h2>
  <p>Without clean water, you’re toast in 72 hours. A LifeStraw or Sawyer filter weighs nothing and saves everything. Don’t trust any puddle without it.</p>

  <h2>2. Multi-Tool</h2>
  <p>Pliers, blade, screwdriver, can opener — all in one weaponized chunk of steel. Never go full Rambo without one in your bag.</p>

  <h2>3. Mylar Blanket</h2>
  <p>Looks like foil. Feels like survival. Keeps you warm, dry, and can even reflect heat or serve as a signal. Lightweight, cheap, effective.</p>

  <h2>4. Tactical Flashlight</h2>
  <p>You’ll be moving at night. A good flashlight doubles as a blinder, a weapon, and a signal. Rechargeable? Even better.</p>

  <h2>5. Ferro Rod</h2>
  <p>When lighters die and matches rot, the ferro rod still throws sparks. Learn to use it. Bonus points if you don’t burn your eyebrows off.</p>

  <h2>6. Duct Tape</h2>
  <p>Patch gear. Seal wounds. Muzzle an idiot. The uses are endless. Wrap it around a water bottle to save space.</p>

  <h2>7. First Aid Kit</h2>
  <p>Boo-boos and bullet wounds. You’ll need to treat both. Stock gauze, tape, gloves, antiseptic, and a blood-stopper bandage or two.</p>

  <h2>8. Collapsible Water Bottle</h2>
  <p>Fills when needed, flattens when not. Hydration without the bulk. Pair it with your filter and drink like a nomadic king.</p>

  <h2>9. Paracord</h2>
  <p>Tie it. Trap with it. Climb with it if you're nuts. 550 cord is the Swiss Army Knife of rope. You can even use the guts as fishing line.</p>

  <h2>10. Local Map & Compass</h2>
  <p>GPS is cute—until the grid dies. A real map and compass can get you out of hell... if you know how to read them.</p>

  <p><em>Your bug-out bag isn’t just about gear. It’s about mindset. Pack to live, not to impress. Leave the nonsense behind. Grab grit. Get gone.</em></p>
